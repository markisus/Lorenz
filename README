Tweak the settings and hit "remake"

Uses external libraries dat.gui.min.js and gee.min.js  

3d.js:  
Uses simple linear approximation to compute solution to Lorenz attractor  
differential equations. The quality of the approximation can be controlled  
through a GUI. The length of the cuve can also be controlled.  Making the  
the approximation too good may make your computer tired.  Conceivably, you  
could change the diff eq's to plot any other curves.  
The 3D rotation is done through the well known matrix rotation linear  
transforms.
